### Introduction
The project name is "Conway's Game of Life (j855liu)", this project is made by Junyi Liu, j855liu, id:20825588
### Feature
The feature I chose is the second feature that the game supports a manual mode. 
This manual mode can be turned on in two ways:
1. Act on the button "Manual"(by clicking or keyboard selection).
2. Press key "M".
To turn off manual mode, there are also two ways:
1. Act on the button "Manual"
2. Hold key "Control" and press key "M"

When manual mode is turned on, the bottom status bar indicates "Manual On" and a button "Next" appears on the toolbar.
By either act on the button "Next" or press key "N", the user can move to the next frame.
